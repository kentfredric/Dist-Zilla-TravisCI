=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::App::Command::chainsmoke - continuously smoke your dist on your CI server

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   dzil chainsmoke [ --mvdt ] [ --silentci ] [ --remote_branch {remote}/{branch} ]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command smokes the distribution on TravisCI, by rebuilding the YML file, adding a commit,
and pushing the branch.  The branch is checked for dirty files and remote freshness prior to
chain smoking, as a safeguard against Git mistakes.  Unlike the plugin version, this doesn't
add anything to the build directory.

Of course, you still need to turn on TravisCI and the remote still needs to be a GitHub repo
for any of this to work.

=head1 OPTIONS

=head2 --mvdt

This enables the L<minimum version dependency testing feature|Dist::Zilla::TravisCI::MVDT>
from the plugin.  It is HIGHLY recommended that you read up on this feature first, and if this
is the first time doing these tests on this distro (which the option implies), you should
start a new topic branch first, to prevent history pollution on your master/stable branch.

=head2 --silentci

This will turn off all notification (email or IRC) from Travis-CI for the test.  Useful if
you are running through MVDT and you don't want a lot of spam from it.  You will, of course,
need to watch for test results from Travis as they happen.

=head2 --remote_branch {remote/branch}

This allows you to specify a remote branch to push to.  The default is the same branch that
your currently in, via 'origin'.

As a safeguard, the default is changed to 'origin/chainsmoking/{local}' while on 'master' or
'stable', or 'origin/chainsmoking/mvdt' if you specify C<--mvdt> without a C<--remote_branch>
option.  But, you should really just create/switch the local branch yourself to keep from
polluting your local repo's master history.

=head1 CHAIN SMOKING?

   SineSwiper: rjbs: so, I think I'm going to make this Travis-CI plugin I'm making add in a command called "smokeci"
   SineSwiper: any comments on implementation?
   SineSwiper: the potential exists that other plugins could be made (which would be mutually exclusive, of course) that
               could interface with other CIs
   PerlJam: SineSwiper: what's smokeci do?  Is that like continuous smoking?  I'd call it "burn" or something if so :)
   SineSwiper: smoke testing on the CI
   SineSwiper: PerlJam: heh, continuous smoking
   SineSwiper: maybe I should call it chainsmoke
   PerlJam: SineSwiper++  yes! :)
   rjbs: haha
   SineSwiper: okay, that will be the command name
   SineSwiper: I hated the lack of punct between smoke and ci, anyway
