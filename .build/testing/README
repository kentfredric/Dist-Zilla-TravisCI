DESCRIPTION

 What is Travis CI?

    Travis CI <https://travis-ci.org/> is pure awesome! Travis is a free
    and open source CI platform that hooks directly into GitHub
    <https://github.com/>. It's extremely easy to configure, tests on every
    major 5.10+ Perl version, and will notify you of test results, either
    through email or IRC. (Yes, a bot will jump into an IRC room, tell you
    the results, and bounce. How cool is that?!)

    If you're not familiar with CI platforms, this is your chance to get
    your feet wet. CI stands for Continuous Integration
    <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration>. This kind of
    testing is designed around testing your code every time you commit/push
    a change. In this case, this is a hook into Git via GitHub to make sure
    that any change you make is going to pass tests.

 Perl is already a "test-heavy" community. What does this add?

    This is true. Travis CI has a much more profound use with languages
    without a deep-seated testing platform like Perl's t/* directory (and
    its hooks with CPAN).

    However, adding Travis CI to your test platform has its benefits:

      * Testing in a plain vanilla environment, which your work environment
      is most definitely NOT.

      * Testing with Perl 5.10, 5.12, 5.14, 5.16, and beyond, all at the
      same time.

      * Testing your DZIL environment, which not even CPAN can do.

      * Use Windows or some other non-Linux OS for your work environment?
      Great. Travis runs on Ubuntu, so you can confirm that it works on
      Linux. (Eventually, Travis will support other OSs, like Windows, to
      make this even sweeter!)

      * Minimum Version Dependency Testing

      * Public announcements of test results. If somebody breaks something
      in master, make sure EVERYBODY knows it!

      * If nothing else, you get many more tests before it even touchs
      CPAN.

 What about the automated CPAN testers?

    They're great! But they are also a bit too late in the process. Sure,
    you can fix what you find after you've found something, but you want
    some extra insurance that your production release is actually
    production ready.

    Development releases on CPAN also work, but you have no idea what is on
    those CPAN tester platforms. Does it cover the full gamut of Perl
    versions, or are they just grabbing the latest? Are they all using the
    latest module dependencies (which may not be want you want)?

    You have more control over your Travis CI platform, so you can set up
    the environment the way you want it. That's not to say that the massive
    CPAN tester army isn't a great boon for Perl, but in the fight against
    bugs, you want every weapon available.

 This sounds complicated...

    Actually, it's the polar opposite of complicated. This is literally a
    full guide on how to make it work:

      1. Sign into Travis CI <http://travis-ci.org/users/auth/github> with
      your GitHub account.

      2. Flip a bit on your distro through the profile page
      <https://travis-ci.org/profile>.

      3. Put the TravisYML plugin in your dist.ini.

    There's some extra configuration you can do: build branches, MVDT, etc.
    But, that's the basic setup. Easy!

DONATIONS

    Travis CI is a completely free service, and they put in a lot of hard
    work to make it what it is.

    Please donate! <https://love.travis-ci.org/>

TODO

      * MVDT - Yes, I actually need to finish MVDT on my own distros.
